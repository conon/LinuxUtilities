A set of general linux utilities written in C for fun.
I will be adding more tools periodically without any particular order.
They have been tested only on Linux.

'make compile' will compile them

'make install' install them in the new created LinuxUtilities directory.

'make clean' will clean up everything including LinuxUtilities directory.


compile:
	make
	
install:
	make install
	
clean:
	make clean
